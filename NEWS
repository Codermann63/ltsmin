<DATE> - Release <VERSION.NEXT> of the LTSmin toolset

 * New frontend for PBESs. The systems are translated into parity
   games which can be exhaustively explored using the analysis
   algorithms.
    o pbes-reach for symbolic state space generation
    o pbes2lts-grey/gsea for enumerative state space generation
    o pbes2lts-mpi/hre for distributed state space generation
    o spgsolver a symbolic parity game solver
    o PGSolver file output format ('{ast}.pg')
 * Updated SpinJa frontend that accommodates support for valid end-state
   filtering, guards for POR, assertion violation detection and never claims.
 * New parallel BBD package: Sylvan
    o See <thesis Tom van Dijk> for description
    o BDD operations are parallelized using the WOOL framework
      (included)
    o Use: *-reach --vset=sylvan
    o Supported platforms: Linux 64bit
 * Optimized multi-core data structures and algorithms
    o Reduced tree memory usage by 50% by splitting table for roots and leafs.
      Set the relative ratio using: --ratio=n (n=2 by default)
    o Created a new tree that uses a parallel Cleary table to store roots
      halving memory usage in the best case (--state=cleary-tree)
    o Reduced memoized hash sizes to 16 bit.
    o Introduced a non-indexing tree that skips the root node for lookups
      (used automatically if indices are not required by MCNDFs algorithms or
      by tracing facility)
    o Reduced initialization times by using calloc instead of malloc+memset
    o Thread-local initialization and allocation for better NUMA performance
    o Introduced 64 bit hashing, prime rehashing and Murmur hash function.
    o New load balancer with simplified interface.

   search and a number of variations

   AtermDD and ListDD (<spec>-reach --saturation=sat) (Tien-Loong Siaw)
 * Dependency matrix regrouping using simulated annealing (-rgsa, -rcsa)

   and preprocessor defines
 * New experimental I/O library and run-time environment

   (Jeroen Ketema)

September 17, 2009 - Release 1.4 of the LTSmin toolset.

 * New tool ce-mpi for distributed cycle elimination
   (Simona Orzan)
 * New tool ltsmin-tracepp for pretty-printing traces to
   deadlock states
 * TorX support factored out into separate tools
   {lpo,lps,nips}2torx

March 31, 2009 - Release 1.2 of the LTSmin toolset.

The main improvements in this release are:
 * Option parsing is now performed using the popt library. Thus, all
   long options now start with a double minus.
 * The user can choose between BuDDy and ATermDD as the decision diagram
   library used in the symbolic tools.
 * A new compressed file format for labeled transition systems with
   arbitrary numbers of state and edge labels has been implemented.
 * The symbolic tools can write the results of the reachability analysis
   in the form of an ETF (Enumerated Table Format) file. This ETF file
   can be used as input for the reachabilty tools and can be directly
   translated to DVE.
