December 1, 2009 - Release 1.5 of the LTSmin toolset.

* New frontend DVE (requires DiVinE-cluster)
* Bignum support for state counts in spec-reach tools
  (Jeroen Ketema)
* spec-reach clean-up
* 'tree' vector set implementation based on AtermDD

September 17, 2009 - Release 1.4 of the LTSmin toolset.

 * New tool ce-mpi for distributed cycle elimination
   (Simona Orzan)
 * New tool ltsmin-tracepp for pretty-printing traces to
   deadlock states
 * TorX support factored out into separate tools
   {lpo,lps,nips}2torx
 * Enumerative DFS support
 * Enumerative deadlock detection and trace output
 * Reworked ETF support (non-backwards compatible)
 * bash completion for LTSmin tools (see contrib/)

July 10, 2009 - Release 1.3 of the LTSmin toolset.

 * Regrouping optimizations of the PINS matrix
 * Connection to the CADP toolkit via pins_open
 * Tuning of the BDD usage
 * Significant performance improvements
 * Symbolic deadlock detection and trace output

March 31, 2009 - Release 1.2 of the LTSmin toolset.

The main improvements in this release are:
 * Option parsing is now performed using the popt library. Thus, all
   long options now start with a double minus.
 * The user can choose between BuDDy and ATermDD as the decision diagram
   library used in the symbolic tools.
 * A new compressed file format for labeled transition systems with
   arbitrary numbers of state and edge labels has been implemented.
 * The symbolic tools can write the results of the reachability analysis
   in the form of an ETF (Enumerated Table Format) file. This ETF file
   can be used as input for the reachabilty tools and can be directly
   translated to DVE.
