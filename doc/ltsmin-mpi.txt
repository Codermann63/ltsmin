== NAME
ltsmin-mpi - distributed minimization of labelled transition systems

== SYNOPSIS
mpirun _<nodespec>_ {manname} [OPTION] '<input>' '<output>'

== DESCRIPTION
This tool reduces a labeled transition system modulo bisimulation.
The default bisimulation is strong bisimulation.
Both input and output can be a GCF archive or a set of files.
To use a set of files the argument needs and occurrence of ++%s++.
If no ++%s++ is present then a GCF archive is assumed.

The tool uses http://www.mpi-forum.org/[MPI] for distributed
computation, thus it has to be started via `mpirun`.  _nodespec_
determines which processors the tool is run on.

The workers send messages to themselves. So if you use http://www.open-mpi.org/[Open MPI],
you have to use +mpirun -mca btl <connect>,self <nodespec>+ where
<connect> can be tcp, mx, ib, etc. 

The tool uses MPI-IO, the I/O chapter in MPI-2, so if your MPI implementation
has special extensions in MPI-IO, such as http://www.pvfs.org/[PVFS2], then
those extensions are supported.

== OPTIONS
*-plain*::
Disable compression of the output.
The tool detects if the input is compressed or not.

*-s*::
Apply strong bisimulation reduction. This is the default.

*-b*::
Apply branching bisimulation reduction.

*-help*::
Print a help message.

*-q*::
        Be quiet; do not print anything to the terminal.

== EXAMPLES
In this example, we assume Open MPI with a TCP interconnect.

Working with the LTS, we generated in the example for linkman:instantiator-mpi[1], we
can now apply strong bisimulation reduction.

----
mpirun -np 2 -mca btl tcp,self ltsmin-mpi -s brp.gcf brp-s.gcf
----

Subsequently, we can reduce the result modulo branching bisimulation and write
it in the uncompressed format that is compatible with the mCRL tools:

----
mkdir brp-b.dir
mpirun -np 2 -mca btl tcp,self ltsmin-mpi -plain -b brp-s.gcf brp-b.dir/%s
----


== EXIT STATUS
0::
        Successful termination.
1::
        Some error occurred.
