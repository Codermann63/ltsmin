== NAME
instantiator-mpi - distributed generation of labelled transition systems

== SYNOPSIS
mpirun _<nodespec>_ {manname} [OPTION]... 'file.tbf'

== DESCRIPTION
{manname} generates a labelled transition system from a specification
provided in 'file.tbf'.  Specifications are in _tbf_ format and are
commonly generated by linkman:mcrl[1] or linkman:mcrl2[1].

The tool uses http://www.mpi-forum.org/[MPI] for distributed
computation, thus it has to be started via `mpirun`.  _nodespec_
determines which processors the tool is run on.

== OPTIONS
*-alt* rewriter::
       Use _rewriter_.  Possible values are: +rw+, +rww+.
        
*-v*::
        Increase the level of verbosity

*-q*::
        Be quiet; do not print anything to the terminal.

*-fmt* 'format'::
        Write output as separate files.  Format should have one
        occurrence of a literal '%s'.

*-gcf* 'file'::
        Write output to 'file' as a GCF archive.

*-nolb*::
        Disable load balancing.

*-nice* value::
        Set linkman:nice[1] value to _value_.

*-plain*::
        Disable output compression.

*-cmp*::
        Compare terms in term vector; this is useful if the
        representation of data is not unique, e.g., when a set is
        represented by an unsorted list.

*-seq-rw*::
        Perform initialisation of rewriters sequentially rather than
        in parallel. (Needed for the +rw+ rewriter.)

*-master-no-step*::
        Instruct master to act as database only; this improves latency
        of database lookups.

*-help*::
        Print help message.

*-st-help*::
        Print help for the mCRL stepper.

== EXIT STATUS
0::
        Successful termination.
1::
        Some error occurred.

== EXAMPLES
We use *mcrl* to generate from 'brp.mcrl' a _tbf_ specification 'brp.tbf'.
From this, we instantiate a labelled transition system in _DIR_ format
using the +rww+ rewriter.  The computation is performed on two MPI
nodes:
----
mcrl -regular -nocluster brp.mcrl
mpirun -np 2 instantiator-mpi -alt rww brp.tbf
----
