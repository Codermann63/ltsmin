== NAME
gcf - Build and extract GCF archives.

== SYNOPSIS
gcf <gcf> [file1 [file2 [...]]]

gcf <gcf> directory

gcf -x <gcf> <outputspec>


== DESCRIPTION
This tool can build a GCF archive from a given list of files or from all files within a given directory.
It can extract the files from a GCF archive and write them to a directory or to a set of files given by a pattern.

A GCF archive provides interleaved storage of multiple large files within one very large file.
The GCF file structure was designed with distributed file systems and distributed applications in mind.
The key points of the structure are that a GCF file contains one or more clusters and each of those clusters contains
2 or more blocks. One block in each cluster is reserved for meta data.

== OPTIONS

*-q*::
Suppress the printing of runtime information.

*-z <compression>*::
Set the compression method for all files.
The default compression is gzip. To use a different level of gzip compression
you can use *-z "gzip<level>"*. To disable all forms of compression
use *-z ""*

*-x*::
Enables extraction of a GCF archive.

*-help*::
Print a help message.

*-bs <block size>*::
Set the block size to be used for copying streams.
This is also used as the GCF block size.

*-bc <block count>*::
Set the number of blocks in one GCF cluster.

== EXIT STATUS
