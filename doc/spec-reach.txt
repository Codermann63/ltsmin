== SYNOPSIS

lpo-reach [OPTION]... 'file.tbf'

lps-reach [OPTION]... 'file.lps'

nips-reach [OPTION]... 'file.b'

== DESCRIPTION
lpo-reach performs a reachability analysis on a specification
provided in 'file.tbf'.  Specifications are in _tbf_ format and are
commonly generated by linkman:mcrl[1] or linkman:mcrl22mcrl[1].

lps-reach performs a reachability analysis on a specification
provided in 'file.lps'.  Specifications are in _lps_ format and are
commonly generated by linkman:mcrl22lps[1].

nips-reach performs a reachability analysis on a specification
provided in 'file.b'.


== OPTIONS
*-v*::
        Increase the level of verbosity

*-q*::
        Be quiet; do not print anything to the terminal.

*-help*::
        Print help message.

*-bfs*::
	Set breadth first search (BFS) as the exploration strategy. This is the default.
This version uses decision diagrams for both the set of visited states and the level.

*-bfs2*::
	Set BFS as the exploration order. This version always extends the visited set.

*-chain*::
	Use a chaining strategy to explore. When using BFS, the tool performs the next state computation
for all edge groups on the current level or current set of visited states. To chain means to
apply next state for the first group to the visited states, then
apply next state for the second group to the result, etc. Thus, a chaining analysis can be completed
in much less iterations than a BFS analysis.

== mCRL OPTIONS

The command line is passed to the mCRL library, so all of the usual stepper options are interpreted.
Please note that some combinations can lead to incorrect results. One of the safe options is:

*-alt* rewriter::
       Use _rewriter_.  Allowed values depend on the linkman:mcrl[1]
       library.  Commonly, the following are provided: +rw+, +rww+,
       +jitty+.

== ATerm OPTIONS

The command line is passed to ATinit, so the standard ATerm library options are available.
To find out which ones use the option below.

*-at-help*::
	Get a list of ATerm library options.

== EXIT STATUS
0::
        Successful termination.
>0::
        Some error occurred.
