== NAME

ltsmin - Overview of the LTSmin toolset.

== SYNOPSIS

This man page provides an overview of the tools in the LTSmin toolset.

== Language Modules

The LTSmin toolset was designed to support multiple languages. All tools for
a specific language start with a prefix that indicates the language. Below,
we list the languages and the prefixes that are supported in this release:

DVE(+dve+,+dve2+)::

The DVE language.  See the
http://divine.fi.muni.cz/[DiVinE website].

ETF(+etf+)::

The Enumerated Table Format is an intermediate format for models in the LTSmin
toolset. See manpage:etf[5].

mCRL2(+lps+)::

The mCRL2 language. See the
http://www.mcrl2.org/[mCRL2 website].

muCRL(+lpo+)::

The muCRL language. See the
http://www.cwi.nl/~mcrl/[muCRL website].

PROMELA(+spinja+)::

The PROMELA language is supported via the included version of spinja,
which generates C code implementing the PINS interface. See the
http://spinroot.com/[Spin website]
and the
http://code.google.com/p/spinja/[SpinJa website].

UPPAAL(+opaal+)
The UPPAAL xml language for timed automata is supported via the opaal
successor generator. Currently only multi-core reachability is supported
(manpage:opaal2lts-mc[1]).
See the opaal website:
https://code.launchpad.net/~opaal-developers/opaal/opaal-ltsmin-succgen[opaal website]

PBES(+pbes+)
Specifications in _pbes_ format generated by manpage:lps2pbes[1] are
reduced to parity games. These can then be solved (symbolically) by
manpage:spgsolver[1].

== State Space Exploration Tools

The LTSmin toolset has six tools for reachability analysis:

<prefix>-reach::
Symbolic reachability tools that use decision diagrams for manipulating sets
of states. The optional output produced by these tools is an ETF model.
+
See manpage:dve-reach[1], manpage:dve2-reach[1], manpage:etf-reach[1],
manpage:lps-reach[1], manpage:lpo-reach[1],
and manpage:spinja-reach[1].

<prefix>2lts-grey::

Sequential state space generators that enumerate states and can use
both decision diagrams and (tree-compressed) hash tables to represent sets of
states. The optional output produced by these tools is an explicit LTS.
+
See manpage:dve2lts-grey[1], manpage:dve22lts-grey[1], manpage:etf2lts-grey[1],
manpage:lps2lts-grey[1], manpage:lpo2lts-grey[1],
and manpage:spinja2lts-grey[1].

<prefix>2lts-gsea::

Sequential state space generators that enumerate states and can use
both decision diagrams and (tree-compressed) hash tables to represent sets of
states. The optional output produced by these tools is an explicit LTS.
These tools are based on an extended version of the
http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10009-008-0093-y[General State Exploring
Algorithm (GSEA)].
+
See manpage:dve2lts-gsea[1], manpage:dve22lts-gsea[1], manpage:etf2lts-gsea[1],
manpage:lps2lts-gsea[1], manpage:lpo2lts-gsea[1],
and manpage:spinja2lts-gsea[1].

<prefix>2lts-mc::

Concurrent (multi-core) state space generators and model checkers.
Enumeration uses lockless (tree-compressed) hash tables to represent sets of
states. Model checking of LTL is supported by a set of multi-core NDFS
algorithms. To input LTL-formulae, onecan use the PINS2PINS wrapper (--ltl)
or an LTL cross-product computed by the frontend (DiVinE 2 property models or
PROMELA models via SpinJa with never claim). 
+
See manpage:dve2lts-mc[1], manpage:dve22lts-mc[1], manpage:etf2lts-mc[1],
manpage:opaal2lts-mc[1] and manpage:spinja2lts-mc[1].

<prefix>2lts-mpi::

Distributed state space generators that enumerate states and use
distributed hash tables for storing sets of states.
The optional output produced by these tools is an explicit LTS.
These tools do not work without MPI.
+
See manpage:dve2lts-mpi[1], manpage:dve22lts-mpi[1], manpage:etf2lts-mpi[1],
manpage:lps2lts-mpi[1], manpage:lpo2lts-mpi[1],
and manpage:spinja2lts-mpi[1].

<prefix>2lts-hre::

Distributed state space generators that enumerate states and use
distributed hash tables for storing sets of states.
The optional output produced by these tools is an explicit LTS.
These tools work with MPI, multiple threads or multiple process whenever possible and available.
For example:
+
--
* MacOS X does not support the multiple process architecture at this time.
* Neither mCRL nor mCRL2 supports multi threading.
--
+

== Mini Tutorial

As running example, we use a model of the bounded retransmission
protocol from the mCRL examples. Assuming we have copied the file
'brp.mcrl' to our working directory, we can linearize the model with
the following command:
----
mcrl -regular -nocluster brp.mcrl
----
This produces a file named 'brp.tbf'. This is the input for the state
space generator. Just to see how many states and transitions are produced,
we can run the command
----
lpo2lts-grey brp.tbf
----
Assuming that the model is small and CADP is installed, we can simply generate a BCG file
----
lpo2lts-grey brp.tbf brp.bcg
----
and then use CADP.

If it turns out that the LTS was very big then we might want to use the distributed tools
to generate and reduce the LTS:
----
mpirun -np 4 -mca btl tcp,self lpo2lts-mpi brp.tbf brp.dir
mpirun -np 4 -mca btl tcp,self ltsmin-mpi brp.dir brp-s.dir
ltsmin-convert --segments 1 brp-s.dir brp-s.bcg
----

The dir format used to store the LTS in the example is backwards compatible with the mCRL toolset.
We also support a newer format that adds compression:
----
mpirun -np 4 -mca btl tcp,self lpo2lts-mpi brp.tbf brp.gcf
mpirun -np 4 -mca btl tcp,self ltsmin-mpi brp.gcf brp-s.gcf
ltsmin-convert --segments 1 brp-s.gcf brp-s.bcg
----

When the model is suitable, state space generation can be speeded up by memoizing next state calls:
----
mpirun -np 4 -mca btl tcp,self lpo2lts-mpi --cache brp.tbf brp.gcf
----

=== symbolic tools

The LTSmin tool set also has a symbolic reachability tool.
If we want to know the number of states, we can give the command:

----
lpo-reach brp.tbf
----

This command will compute the necessary part of the transition relation and the
set of reachable states. If we want to record the necessary part of the transition relation
then we can do so in the form of an ETF file:

----
lpo-reach brp.tbf brp.etf
----

This etf file can be translated to DVE for model checking:
----
etf-convert brp.etf brp.dve
----

It can also serve as the input for state space generation
----
mpirun -np 4 -mca btl tcp,self etf2lts-mpi brp.etf brp-s.gcf
----

=== parity game solvers

The LTSmin toolset finally includes a parity game solver.

---
spgsolver game.spg
---

To tool reports whether the game successfully terminates.
