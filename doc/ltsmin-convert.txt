== NAME
ltsmin-convert - convert file formats for labelled transition system 

== SYNOPSIS
{manname} [OPTION] '<input>' '<output>'

== DESCRIPTION
This tool copies the input to the output and changes the achive format on-the-fly.
Both input and output format are detected by pattern matching in the following table:

++\*.dir++:: DIR format in a directory.
++\*.bcg++:: BCG file format. The format is always detected, but BCG can only be read or written if CADP was enabled during compilation.
++\*%s\*++:: DIR+ format for reading and DIR format for writing using a set of files.
++*++:: DIR+ format using a GCF archive.

The difference between DIR and DIR+ format is the former uses uncompressed files and the latter support compression.
It is possible that a directory named .dir actually contain DIR+ format.
This tool will read that directory, but the tools from the mCRL toolset will failed with the error message
----
wrong file version: 0
----
If that happens then you may convert the directory by typing the command:
----
ltsmin-convert bad.dir good.dir
----

== OPTIONS


*-segments*::
Set the number of segments in the output file.
If the output format does not support segmentation (BCG) then the default is 1 and
specifying any number other than 1 is an error. Otherwise, the default is the same
number of segments as the input. Please note that the algorithm used for changing
the number of segments is simple. It guarantees that the number of states in the output is balanced,
but not much more. E.g. if the input is in BFS order and just one segment then
then the output will still be in BFS order. however, if the input has more than one segment then
BFS order is lost.

*-plain*::
Disable output compression. Input compression is detected. For file sets and .dir directories output
compression is disabled by default.

*-bs <block size>*::
Set the block size to be used for copying streams.
This is also used as the GCF block size.

*-bc <block count>*::
Set the number of blocks in one GCF cluster.

*-q*::
Suppress all warning and information messages.

*-help*::
        Print help message.

== EXAMPLES
The expected use of this tool is to convert (uncompressed) _DIR_ to GCF and back:

----
ltsmin-convert brp.dir/%s brp.cgf
mkdir brp.dir ; ltsmin-convert -plain brp.gcf brp.dir/%s
----

== EXIT STATUS
0::
        Successful termination.
>0::
        Some error occurred.
