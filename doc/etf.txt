== NAME
etf - enumerated table format

== SYNOPSIS
A text based intermediate format for PINS models.

== DESCRIPTION

An ETF file is a sequence of sections.

* The first section must be a state section, describing the state vector.
* There must be a single init section, describing the initial state(s).
* There can be 0 or more map sections, defining a state label each.
* There can be 0 or more sort section, describing the values of sorts.
* There can be 0 or more trans sections, describing a partition of the transition relation each.

== GRAMMER

----
etf         ::= state ( trans | map | sort )* init ( trans | map | sort )*
state       ::= "begin state"
                declaration*
                "end state"
init        ::= "begin init"
                state*
                "end init"
map         ::= "begin map" ident valspec
                mapentry*
                "end map" 
trans       ::= "begin trans" valspec*
                transentry*
                "end trans"
sort        ::= "begin sort" ident
                value*
                "end ident"
declaration ::= (ident | "_") ":" (ident | "_")
state       ::= number *
valspec     ::= ident | ("[" ident "]")
mapentry    ::= ( number | "*" ) * ( value | number )
transentry  ::= ((number "/" number)|"*")* ( value | number )*
number      ::= ['0'..'9']+
----

Note that the current parser is line based and requires that every section entry is one line and
that the begins and end are also lines. Also note that value is undefined in this table. For now,
the tool will accept any white space free string in the map and trans sections and will
accept any printable character on a line in a sort section.
