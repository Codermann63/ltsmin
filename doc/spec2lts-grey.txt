== NAME
lpo2lts-grey, lps2lts-grey, nips2lts-grey - Sequential state space generator

== SYNOPSIS

lpo2lts-grey [OPTION]... 'file.tbf'

lps2lts-grey [OPTION]... 'file.lps'

nips2lts-grey [OPTION]... 'file.b'

== Description

lpo2lts-grey generates a labelled transition system from a specification
provided in 'file.tbf'.  Specifications are in _tbf_ format and are
commonly generated by linkman:mcrl[1] or linkman:mcrl22mcrl[1]. 

lps2lts-grey generates a labelled transition system from a specification
provided in 'file.lps'.  Specifications are in _lps_ format and are
commonly generated by linkman:mcrl22lps[1].

nips2lts-grey generates a labelled transition system from a specification
provided in 'file.b'.

== OPTIONS
*-v*::
        Increase the level of verbosity

*-q*::
        Be quiet; do not print anything to the terminal.

*-out* 'archive'::
	Specifiy the name of the output archive.
        This will be a pattern archive if 'archive' contains ++%s++
        and a GCF archive otherwise.

*-plain*::
        Disable output compression.

*-help*::
        Print help message.

*-cache*::
	Add the caching wrapper around the model.

*-nolts*::
	Disable writing of the LTS.

*-black*::
	Use the black box call (TransitionsAll) this is the default.

*-grey*::
	Use the box call (TransitionsLong). Meant for testing purposes.

*-vset*::
	Use a vector set (decision diagram) instead of a tree compressed hash table to store the
set of states. This option requires the use of -nolts and forbids the use of -out because
the DIR format requires state numbers and when using decision diagrams state numbers are
difficult to obtain.

== mCRL OPTIONS

The command line is passed to the mCRL library, so all of the usual stepper options are interpreted.
Please note that some combinations can lead to incorrect results. One of the safe options is:

*-alt* rewriter::
       Use _rewriter_.  Allowed values depend on the linkman:mcrl[1]
       library.  Commonly, the following are provided: +rw+, +rww+,
       +jitty+.


== ATerm OPTIONS

The command line is passed to ATinit, so the standard ATerm library options are available.
To find out which ones use the option below.

*-at-help*::
	Get a list of ATerm library options.

== EXIT STATUS
0::
        Successful termination.
>0::
        Some error occurred.
