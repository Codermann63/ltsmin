*--strategy*='TYPE'::
        Select exploration strategy.  'TYPE' can be one of the
        following options:

bfs;;
  explore state space in breadth-first order (default).

dfs;;
  explore state space in depth-first order.

scc;;
  perform LTL model checking based on Buchi automata with Couvreur's
  algorithm (accepting cycle detection).  This requires an accepting
  state label to be present.  See below.

*--state*='TYPE'::
        Select type of data structure for storing visited states.
        'TYPE' can be one of the following options:

tree;;
  use a tree-compressed hash table (default).

table;;
  use a hash table.
 
vset;;
  use a vector set (decision diagram).

*--max*='LEVEL'::
    Search until level 'LEVEL'

*--dot*='DOTFILE'::

    Export the generated state space in Dot format, suitable for
    processing with GraphViz tools (e.g., manpage:dot[1]).
+
'DOTFILE' designates the filename to output the Dot specification to.
+
WARNING: Using Dot export on state spaces larger thousand
         states will likely overwhelm the manpage:dot[1] tool.
