*--order*='ORDER'::
        Select the exploration strategy: 'bfs-prev', 'bfs', 'chain-prev',
        or 'chain'. With 'bfs-prev' and 'bfs', breadth-first search is
        used. Here, 'bfs-prev' only considers the states found at the
        previous level, while 'bfs' considers the whole visited set. With
        'chain-prev' and 'chain', a chaining strategy is used. Here,
        'chain-prev' at each level starts from the states found at the
        previous level, while 'chain' uses the whole cisited set. Defaults
        to 'bfs-prev'.

When using breadth-frist search, the tool performs the next state computation
for all edge groups on the current level or current set of visited states.
Chaining means to apply next state for the first group to the visited
states, then apply next-state for the second group to the result,
etc.  Thus, a chaining analysis can be completed in much less
iterations than a BFS analysis.

*--saturation*='SATURATION'::
        Select an experimental saturation-like strategy: 'none', 'sat1',
        'sat2', 'sat3'. The strategy works in combination with the order to
        saturate BDD levels. Defaults to 'none', i.e. no saturation.

*--G*='GRANULARITY'::
        Select the granularity of the saturation-like strategy. This works
        in combination with 'sat2' and 'sat3'. Defaults to 10.

*--action*='ACTION'::
        Find a transition labelled with 'ACTION'. Returns with exit code 1
        if such a transition is found, otherwise 0.

*--mu*='MUFILE'::
    After computing all reachable states, evaluate the mu-formula in 'MUFILE'
+
'MUFILE' is a file containing an Mu Calculus formula (see
manpage:ltsmin-mu[5]). This formula is a propositional formula with
least and greatest fixpoint operator. It will be evaluated after generation
of the complete state space.

*--ctl**='CTLFILE'::
    Convert a ctl* formula given in 'CTLFILE' (see manpage:ltsmin-ctl[5]) to
    a mu-formula (see manpage:ltsmin-mu[5]), and evaluate the mu-formula after
    computing all reachable states.
