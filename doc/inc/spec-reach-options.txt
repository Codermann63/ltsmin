*--order*='ORDER'::

        Select the exploration strategy: 'bfs', 'bfs2' or 'chain'.  In
        addition, three experimental saturation-like strategies are
        available: 'sat1', 'sat2', 'sat3'.  With 'bfs', breadth-first
        search is used.  With 'bfs2', the visited set is always
        extends the visited set.  With 'chain', a chaining strategy is
        used for exploration.  Defaults to 'bfs'.

When using BFS, the tool performs the next state computation for all
edge groups on the current level or current set of visited states.
Chaining means to apply next state for the first group to the visited
states, then apply next-state for the second group to the result,
etc..  Thus, a chaining analysis can be completed in much less
iterations than a BFS analysis.

*--action*='ACTION'::
        Find a transition labelled with 'ACTION'. Returns with exit code 1
        if such a transition is found, otherwise 0.

*--mu*='MUFILE'::
    After computing all reachable states, evaluate the mu-formula in 'MUFILE'
+
'MUFILE' is a file containing an Mu Calculus formula (see
manpage:ltsmin-mu[5]). This formula is a propositional formula with
least and greatest fixpoint operator. It will be evaluated after generation
of the complete state space.

*--ctl**='CTLFILE'::
    Convert a ctl* formula given in 'CTLFILE' (see manpage:ltsmin-ctl[5]) to
    a mu-formula (see manpage:ltsmin-mu[5]), and evaluate the mu-formula after
    computing all reachable states.
