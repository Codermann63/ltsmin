*--order*='ORDER'::

        Select the exploration strategy: 'bfs', 'bfs2' or 'chain'.  In
        addition, three experimental saturation-like strategies are
        available: 'sat1', 'sat2', 'sat3'.  With 'bfs', breadth-first
        search is used.  With 'bfs2', the visited set is always
        extends the visited set.  With 'chain', a chaining strategy is
        used for exploration.  Defaults to 'bfs'.

When using BFS, the tool performs the next state computation for all
edge groups on the current level or current set of visited states.
Chaining means to apply next state for the first group to the visited
states, then apply next-state for the second group to the result,
etc..  Thus, a chaining analysis can be completed in much less
iterations than a BFS analysis.

*--action*='ACTION'::
        Find a transition labelled with 'ACTION'. Returns with exit code 1
        if such a transition is found, otherwise 0.
