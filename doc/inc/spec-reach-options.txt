*--order*='ORDER'::
        Select the exploration strategy: 'bfs-prev', 'bfs', 'chain-prev',
        or 'chain'. With 'bfs-prev' and 'bfs', breadth-first search is
        used. Here, 'bfs-prev' only considers the states found at the
        previous level, while 'bfs' considers the whole visited set. With
        'chain-prev' and 'chain', a chaining strategy is used. Here,
        'chain-prev' at each level starts from the states found at the
        previous level, while 'chain' uses the whole cisited set. Defaults
        to 'bfs-prev'.

When using breadth-frist search, the tool performs the next state computation
for all edge groups on the current level or current set of visited states.
Chaining means to apply next state for the first group to the visited
states, then apply next-state for the second group to the result,
etc.  Thus, a chaining analysis can be completed in much less
iterations than a BFS analysis.

*--saturation*='SATURATION'::
        Select an experimental saturation-like strategy: 'none', 'sat-like',
        'sat-loop'. The 'sat-like' strategy goes up and down the levels of the
        BDD used to represent the state space. The 'sat-loop' strategy loops
        over the levels. The strategy works in combination with the 'order' to
        saturate levels. Defaults to 'none', i.e. no saturation.

*--sat-granularity*='GRANULARITY'::
        Select the granularity of the saturation-like strategy. Defaults to 10.

*--save-levels*::
        Save the previous states seen at saturation levels. This option has
        effect for any of the saturation strategies in combination with either
        'bfs-prev' or 'chain-prev'.

*--action*='ACTION'::
        Find a transition labelled with 'ACTION'. Returns with exit code 1
        if such a transition is found, otherwise 0.
