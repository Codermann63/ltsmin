=== Greybox Options

*-c*, *--cache*::
    Enable caching of greybox calls.
+
If this option is used, the state space generator makes calls to the
short version of the greybox next-state function and memoizes the
results. If the next-state function is expensive this will yield
substantial speedups.

*-r*, *--regroup*='SPEC'::
    Enable regrouping optimizations on the dependency matrix.
+
'SPEC' is a comma-separated sequence of transformations
'<(_T_,)+>' which are applied in this order to the
dependency matrix.  The following transformations _T_ are available:

gs;;
  Group Safely; macro for "*gc*,*gr*,*cw*,*rs*"; almost
  always a win.

ga;;
  Group Aggressively (row subsumption); macro for
  "*gc*,*rs*,*ru*,*cw*,*rs*"; can be a huge win, but in some
  cases causes slower state space generation.

gc;;
  Group Columns; macro for "*cs*,*cn*".

gr;;
  Group Rows; macro for "*rs*,*rn*".

cs;;
  Column Sort; sort columns lexicographically.

cn;;
  Column Nub; (temporarily) group duplicate columns, thereby making
  'ca' more tractable.  Requires *cs*.

cw;;
  Column sWap; minimize distance between changing columns
  heuristically.  This reordering improves performance of the symbolic
  data structures.

ca;;
  Column All permutations; try to find the column permutation with the
  best cost metric.  Potentially, this is an expensive operation.

rs;;
  Row Sort; sort rows lexicographically.

rn;;
  Row Nub; remove duplicate rows from the dependency matrix.  This is
  always a win.  Requires *rs*.

ru;;
  Row sUbsume; try to remove more rows than nubbing, thereby trading
  speed for memory.  Requires *rs*.
