=== PINS Options

*--labels*::
        Print state variable, type and value names, and state and action labels.
        Then exit.
        Useful for writing predicate (+--invariant+), LTL (+--ltl+),
        CTL/CTL* (+--ctl+), and mu-calculus (+--mu+) expressions.

*--matrix*::
        Print the dependency matrix and exit.

*-c*, *--cache*::
    Enable caching of greybox calls.
+
If this option is used, the state space generator makes calls to the
short version of the greybox next-state function and memoizes the
results. If the next-state function is expensive this will yield
substantial speedups.

*-r*, *--regroup*='SPEC'::
    Enable regrouping optimizations on the dependency matrix.
+
'SPEC' is a comma-separated sequence of transformations
'<(_T_,)+>' which are applied in this order to the
dependency matrix.  The following transformations _T_ are available:

gs;;
  Group Safely; macro for "*gc*,*gr*,*cw*,*rs*"; almost
  always a win.

ga;;
  Group Aggressively (row subsumption); macro for
  "*gc*,*rs*,*ru*,*cw*,*rs*"; can be a huge win, but in some
  cases causes slower state space generation.

gsa;;
  Group Simulated Annealing; macro for "*gc*,*gr*,*csa*,*rs*"; almost
  always a win; usually better than *gs*.

gc;;
  Group Columns; macro for "*cs*,*cn*".

gr;;
  Group Rows; macro for "*rs*,*rn*".

cs;;
  Column Sort; sort columns lexicographically.

cn;;
  Column Nub; (temporarily) group duplicate columns, thereby making
  'ca' more tractable.  Requires *cs*.

cw;;
  Column sWap; minimize distance between columns by swapping them
  heuristically.  This reordering improves performance of the symbolic
  data structures.

ca;;
  Column All permutations; try to find the column permutation with the
  best cost metric.  Potentially, this is an expensive operation.

csa;;
  Column Simulated Annealing; minimize distance between columns by
  swapping them using simulated annealing.

rs;;
  Row Sort; sort rows lexicographically.

rn;;
  Row Nub; remove duplicate rows from the dependency matrix.  This is
  always a win.  Requires *rs*.

ru;;
  Row sUbsume; try to remove more rows than nubbing, thereby trading
  speed for memory.  Requires *rs*.

*--ltl*='LTLFILE|LTLFORMULA'::
    Compute cross-product of a Buchi automaton and the specification
+
'LTLFILE' is a file containing an Linear Temporal Logic formula (see
manpage:ltsmin-ltl[5]).  Which content can also be provided directly as
'LTLFORMULA'.  This formula will be converted to a Buchi
automaton.  Then the synchronous cross product with the original
specification is computed on-the-fly.  A state label is added to
encode accepting states.

*--ltl-semantics*='spin|textbook|ltsmin'::
    Change the semantics of the crossproduct generated using '--ltl'
+
Three options are available, the default is 'spin'.

spin;;
    Use semantics equal to the spin model checker. From the 'source'
    state all transitions are generated. Then, state predicates
    are evaluated on the 'source' state. The Buchi automaton now
    moves according to these predicates.
    Deadlocks in the LTS cause the Buchi to progress independently. 

textbook;;
    Use textbook semantics. A new initial state is generated with an
    outgoing transition to the initial state. Now, predicates
    are evaluated on the 'target' state and the Buchi automaton
    moves according to these predicates.
    Deadlocks in the LTS do NOT cause the Buchi to progress independently.

ltsmin;;
    Same as spin semantics, but now deadlocks in the LTS do NOT cause the Buchi
    to progress independently.


*--por*::
    Activate partial order reduction
+
Partial Order Reduction can reduce the state space when searching
for deadlocks (-d) of accepting cycles (--ltl).

*--proviso*='closedset|stack|color'::
    Change the proviso implementation for partial order reduction (ltl)
+
Change the proviso used to detect that an accepting cycle is closed.
Three options are available, the default is 'closedset'.

closedset;;
    The closed set proviso is the default proviso which requires
    almost no extra work/memory. It might however result in less
    reduction than the 'stack' or 'color' proviso. It works with both
    the dfs- and bfs exploration strategy.

stack;;
    The stack proviso is the proviso used for example by the spin
    model checker. It requires some extra work/memory but may
    result in a better reduction than 'closedset'. It works only
    for a dfs/scc search strategy (since bfs has no stack).

color;;
    The color proviso requires a lot of extra work and memory
    but can significantly improve the reduction. It too works
    only with the dfs/scc search strategies.

NOTE: The proviso option might be used to produce shorter error traces.
