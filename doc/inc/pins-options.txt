=== Greybox Options

*--matrix*::
        Print the dependency matrix and exit.

*-c*, *--cache*::
    Enable caching of greybox calls.
+
If this option is used, the state space generator makes calls to the
short version of the greybox next-state function and memoizes the
results. If the next-state function is expensive this will yield
substantial speedups.

*-r*, *--regroup*='SPEC'::
    Enable regrouping optimizations on the dependency matrix.
+
'SPEC' is a comma-separated sequence of transformations
'<(_T_,)+>' which are applied in this order to the
dependency matrix.  The following transformations _T_ are available:

gs;;
  Group Safely; macro for "*gc*,*gr*,*cw*,*rs*"; almost
  always a win.

ga;;
  Group Aggressively (row subsumption); macro for
  "*gc*,*rs*,*ru*,*cw*,*rs*"; can be a huge win, but in some
  cases causes slower state space generation.

gc;;
  Group Columns; macro for "*cs*,*cn*".

gr;;
  Group Rows; macro for "*rs*,*rn*".

cs;;
  Column Sort; sort columns lexicographically.

cn;;
  Column Nub; (temporarily) group duplicate columns, thereby making
  'ca' more tractable.  Requires *cs*.

cw;;
  Column sWap; minimize distance between changing columns
  heuristically.  This reordering improves performance of the symbolic
  data structures.

ca;;
  Column All permutations; try to find the column permutation with the
  best cost metric.  Potentially, this is an expensive operation.

rs;;
  Row Sort; sort rows lexicographically.

rn;;
  Row Nub; remove duplicate rows from the dependency matrix.  This is
  always a win.  Requires *rs*.

ru;;
  Row sUbsume; try to remove more rows than nubbing, thereby trading
  speed for memory.  Requires *rs*.

*--ltl*='LTLFILE'::
    Compute cross-product of a Buchi automaton and the specification
+
'LTLFILE' is a file containing an Linear Temporal Logic formula (see
manpage:ltsmin-ltl[5]). This formula will be converted to a Buchi
automaton.  Then the synchronous cross product with the original
specification is computed on-the-fly.  A state label is added to
encode accepting states.

*--ltl-semantics*='spin|textbook'::
    Change the semantics of the crossproduct generated using '--ltl'
+
Change the semantics to use incoming or outgoing edges.
Two options are available, the default is 'spin'.

spin;;
    Use semantics similar to the spin model checker. From the 'source'
    state all transitions are generated. Then, state predicates
    are evaluated on the 'source' state. The Buchi automaton now
    moves according to these predicates.

textbook;;
    Use textbook semantics. A new initial state is generated with an
    outgoing transition to the initial state. Now, predicates
    are evaluated on the 'target' state and the Buchi automaton
    moves according to these predicates.
