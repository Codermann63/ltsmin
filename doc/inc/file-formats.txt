== File Formats
The following file formats are supported:

* Directory format ('{ast}.dir' and '{ast}.gcf')
* Binary Coded Graphs ('{ast}.bcg')

The '{ast}.dir' format uses multiple files in a directory by
default. It is also possible to put these files in a GCF archive
('{ast}.gcf'). When the files are put in a directory, the default
is to store them uncompressed, because otherwise the mCRL tools
cannot read the files.
When the files are stored in a GCF archive then the default is
compression enabled.


If you try to open a compressed directory wiht an mCRL tools,
you will get the error message:
----
wrong file version: 0
----
If that happens then you may convert the directory by typing the command:
----
ltsmin-convert bad.dir good.dir
----
