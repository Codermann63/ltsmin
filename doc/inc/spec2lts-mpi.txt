== EXIT STATUS
*0*::
        Successful termination.
*>0*::
        Some error occurred.

== EXAMPLES

As running example, we use a model of the bounded retransmission
protocol from the muCRL examples. Assuming we have copied the file
'brp.mcrl' to our working directory, we can linearize the model with
the following command:

----
mcrl -regular -nocluster brp.mcrl
----

This produces a file named 'brp.tbf'. This is the input for the state
space generator. In order to produce a _DIR_ format output, which
is compatible with the muCRL tools, the tool can be run like this:

----
mpirun -np 2 -mca btl tcp,self lpo2lts-mpi brp.tbf brp.dir
----

In order to create a compressed GCF file, the tool can be run like this:

----
mpirun -np 2 -mca btl tcp,self lpo2lts-mpi brp.tbf brp.gcf
----

This GCF file can be read by linkman:ltsmin-mpi[1], linkman:ltsmin-convert[1].
It cannot be read by the mCRL tools. To convert ++brp.gcf++ to ++brp.dir++,
one can simply extract the GCF file:

----
gcf -x brp.gcf brp.dir
----
