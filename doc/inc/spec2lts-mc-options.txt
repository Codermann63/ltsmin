*--threads*='NUMBER'::
        Number of threads to use for state space exploration
        (default: NUMBER=NUM_CORES). Maximum is 64.


*--strategy*='TYPE'::
        Select exploration strategy (strict exploration orders
        are not guaranteed by the multicore version).
        'TYPE' can be one of the following options:

bfs;;
  explore state space in breadth-first order (default).

dfs;;
  explore state space in depth-first order.


*--state*='TYPE'::
        Select type of data structure for storing visited states.
        'TYPE' can be one of the following options:

table;;
  use a lockless hash table (default).

tree;;
  use a lockless tree-compressed hash table.


*--size*='NUMBER'::
        Log_2 hash table size in elements (default: NUMBER=24).
        This is also used for the internal node table of the tree.


*--lb*='TYPE'::
        Select load-balancing strategy.  'TYPE' can be one of the
        following options:

srp;;
  synchronous random polling (default).

static;;
  initial BFS run, with static hand-off to all threads.

combined;;
  not implemented. Experiments show that SRP overhead is minimal (<5%).


*--handoff*='NUMBER'::
        Maximum number of states to hand off to a thread requesting load
        (default: NUMBER=100). The operation may be expensive, depending
        on the size of the states.


*--gran*='NUMBER'::
        Granularity at which control is handed back to the load balancer
        (default: NUMBER=100). Higher values may reduce runtime
        overhead, but decrease the performance of the load balancer.
        The state space explorer uses the number of transitions as work
        counter.


*--ref*::
        Save space by storing references to table/tree on the stack/queue.
        Normally full states are stored.


*--zobrist*='NUMBER'::
        Save time by using zobrist incremental state hashing.
        NUMBER defines the (log_2) size of the random number table
        (default: 0=OFF). Large tables mean better hash distributions,
        but more cache misses due to memory size.
        Experiments have shown that small tables (2^6) suffice for
        good distributions (equal or better than Jenkin's hash).
        Improvements are only noticable for fast state generators, like
        DiVinE 2.2( manpage:dve22lts-mc[1]).


*--max*='NUMBER'::
        Maximum search depth.
