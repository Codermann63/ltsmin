*--strategy*='TYPE'::
        Select exploration strategy.  'TYPE' can be one of the
        following options:

bfs;;
  explore state space in breadth-first order (default).

dfs;;
  explore state space in depth-first order.

ndfs;;
  perform LTL model checking based on Buchi automata with Nested-DFS
  algorithm.  This requires an accepting state label to be present.
  See below.

scc;;
  perform LTL model checking based on Buchi automata with Couvreur's
  algorithm (accepting cycle detection).  This requires an accepting
  state label to be present.  See below.

*--state*='TYPE'::
        Select type of data structure for storing visited states.
        'TYPE' can be one of the following options:

tree;;
  use a tree-compressed hash table (default).

vset;;
  use a vector set (decision diagram).


*--max*='NUMBER'::
        Maximum search depth.
