*-d*, *--deadlock*::
      Find state with no outgoing transitions.


*-i*, *--invariant*='PREDFILE|PREDEXPRESSION'::
      Find state where the invariant is violated. The file 'PREDFILE'
      contains an expression in a simple predicate language (see
      manpage:ltsmin-pred[5]). Its contents can also be entered directly as
      a 'PREDEXPRESSION'.


*-a*, *--action*='STRING'::
      Find state with an outgoing transtition of type 'STRING'.


*--assert*
    detect assertion errors. Same as --action=assert. Only for Promela (prom)
    frontends.


*--trace*='FILE'_.gcf_::
      When finding a deadlock state or a transition labelled with a certain
      action, write a trace to 'FILE'_.gcf_, beginning from the initial state.
      Traces can be pretty-printed with manpage:ltsmin-tracepp[1].
