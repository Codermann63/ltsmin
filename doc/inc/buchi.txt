== BUCHI AUTOMATA BASED MODEL CHECKING

Buchi automata-based model checking requires states to be marked with
an accepting state label, and a search strategy which takes these
labels into account.

For generating accepting state label information, the following
options are supported:

. The input specification is already combined with a Buchi automaton,
  and states are appropriately marked with accepting labels.  Currently two
  frontends support this functionality: SpinJa (see documentation on +prom+
  tools), and DiVinE (see documentation on +dve+ tools).

. LTSmin tools can build the cross product of input specification and
  Buchi automaton (through a PINS layer) themselves, and will annotate
  cross-product states appropriately when they are accepting.

NOTE: these options cannot be combined; only one can be active at a
time.

NOTE: As of LTSmin release 1.9, our default LTL semantics mimics those of
SPIN/DiVinE. Before that, LTSmin implemented textbook semantics. See
the documentation on the enumerative tools for more information.
