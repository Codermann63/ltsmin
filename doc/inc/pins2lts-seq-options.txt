*--strategy*='TYPE'::
        Select exploration strategy.  'TYPE' can be one of the
        following options:

bfs;;
  explore state space in breadth-first order (default).

dfs;;
  explore state space in depth-first order.

scc;;
  perform LTL model checking based on Buchi automata with Couvreur's
  algorithm (accepting cycle detection).  This requires an accepting
  state label to be present.  See below.
