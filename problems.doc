\page problems Known Problems

\subsection Endianness

The endian detection/configuration is not what it should be. One of the problems is the situation with difference encoding.
To dodifference encoding one must know both the input and output encodings. The current DSsetSwap calls
do not set this order properly.


\subsection empty

The semantics of empty is not so easy to implement: in general to implement it in a wrapper,
a read should be done on the underlying stream and the result buffered.

\subsection buffers

The default buffer size for normal unix files is now 0.
That should be a bit more sensible....

\subsection Mixing old and new dir's

Very dangerous at the moment.


\subsection removing compression from GSF

Because the code is written in the stream itself,
it is difficult to remove while enumerating the stream.

Enumerating might work better if the code was stored in a meta file
and given to the new_item callback.
